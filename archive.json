            "body": "\n<p>Hi!</p>\n<p>If you are subscribed to our repositories, you already know that we defined <a href=\"https://github.com/bem/bem-core/issues?milestone=6&amp;state=open\">a preliminary scope</a> of tasks that would be developed in bem-core v3.</p>\n<p>The major focus we will have on i-bem.js API improvement.</p>\n<p>How we plan to do this?</p>\n<p><strong>First of all</strong>, we plan fairly <a href=\"https://github.com/bem/bem-core/issues/413\">divide i-bem and i-bem__dom</a> into 2 different block-modules. This will increase the accuracy of the API, in particular its methods-helpers will be separated from JS classes.</p>\n<p><strong>Second of all</strong>, we plan to support an ability to work with blocks elements as with i-bem-objects on core level instead of treating them as jQuery-collections. Currently similar functionality is available with <code>elem-instances</code> modifier of <code>i-bem</code>. This will allow us to escape odds with simultaneous existence of elements as jQuery-objects and BEM-instances and create better API (instead of <code>this.setMod(this.elem(&#39;e1&#39;), &#39;m1&#39;, &#39;v1&#39;)</code> we will have <code>this.elem(&#39;e1&#39;).setMod(&#39;m1&#39;, &#39;v1&#39;)</code>). This will also allow to escape the difficult polymorphism of a number of methods inside the core.</p>\n<p><strong>In third place</strong>, we will improve implementation of <a href=\"https://github.com/bem/bem-core/issues/582\">collection support</a> for blocks and elements.</p>\n<p><strong>Fourthly</strong>, <code>ym</code> module system integration will become more tight — block search methods (for instance, <code>.findBlockInside(&#39;b1&#39;)</code>) instead of strings will receive concrete classes of blocks (not clear «magic» will disappear and there will be less potential mistakes).</p>\n<p><strong>Fifthly</strong>, we will think of how to <a href=\"https://github.com/bem/bem-core/issues/394\">unify work with events, especially with live-BEM-events</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Besides</strong>, we will <a href=\"https://github.com/bem/bem-core/issues/576\">implement i18n support</a> in much simple way than in bem-bl, <a href=\"https://github.com/bem/bem-core/issues/491\">will update bem-xjst version</a> that allows us not to wrap in additional guards from cycling apply* constructions in BEMHTML and BEMTREE and will make a number of smaller changes.</p>\n<p>While we plan development process we would like to <strong>ask your feedback</strong> on whether will such changes ease the work with library or we need to do something else?</p>\n<p>If you have and would like to <strong>propose tasks</strong> for v3 — please, do <a href=\"https://github.com/bem/bem-core/issues/new\">create an issue</a>, we will be more than happy!</p>\n<p><strong>Stay BEMed!</strong></p>\n"

For more information about tools and technologies see the <a href=\"https://en.bem.info/libs/bem-components/v2/\">description</a> of the library. </p>\n<p>We recommend you to use source method. The easiest way to start with it is to use a <a href=\"https://github.com/bem/project-stub\">project-stub</a> or BEM <a href=\"https://en.bem.info/tools/bem/bem-stub/\">project generator</a> based on <code>yo</code>. Both of them already contain of bem-components v2.0.0 library.</p>\n<h3 id=\"compiled\"><a href=\"#compiled\" class=\"anchor\"></a>Compiled</h3>\n<p>Used for the projects that do not use any preprocessor or use other than Stylus.</p>\n<p>To get the compiled version of the library, download the <a href=\"https://github.com/bem/bem-components/tree/v2.0.0\">source code</a> of bem-components library, install npm dependencies, and run <code>npm run compiled</code> command in the root directory.</p>\n<h3 id=\"library\"><a href=\"#library\" class=\"anchor\"></a>Library</h3>\n<p>Used to connect bem-components library as a readymade library with the possibility to link  components as JS or CSS bundles to the page.\nTo get the readymade library, you should download the <a href=\"https://github.com/bem/bem-components/tree/v2.0.0\">source code</a> of bem-components, install npm dependencies, and run <code>npm run dist</code> command in the root directory. </p>\n<p>Now you will be able to see the result within the <code>./dist/</code> directory.</p>\n<h2 id=\"compatibility-and-stable-build\"><a href=\"#compatibility-and-stable-build\" class=\"anchor\"></a>Compatibility and stable build</h2>\n<p>Developers using the library way before the release should know that the code base was ready to use for a long time. </p>\n<p>Before announcing v2.0.0 we wanted to test it in the real world, cover all use case scenarios, and write detailed documentation for all blocks in two languages. </p>\n<p>Now, we can say — bem-components v2.0.0 is a stable version. And it could be used for a wide range of tasks on projects of all sizes with no risk.</p>\n<p>One more good news: bem-components library uses <a href=\"http://semver.org/\">semantic versioning</a>. Now, you could use corresponding tags instead of definite commit number.</p>\n<p>All future updates of the library will be more transparent and understandable. </p>\n<p>From now on you may check two information sources – <a href=\"http://semver.org/\">semantic versioning</a> and a changelog file with detailed description of all changes. It will definitely give you a picture of all new features and compatibility between different versions.</p>\n<p>We would love to hear your stories about <a href=\"https://en.bem.info/libs/bem-components/v2.0.0/\">bem-components v2.0.0</a> library usage in the ”wild“, meaning – in your projects :) </p>\n<p>We welcome all your questions and experience notes on our <a href=\"https://en.bem.info/forum/\">forum</a>. Please don’t forget to mark your posts about the library with the <a href=\"https://en.bem.info/forum/?labels=bem-components\">bem-components</a> label.</p>\n<p>Your user feedback and active contribution to the library helps us to improve our library and extend it with new helpful blocks and features. </p>\n<p>Enjoy the update and use, and always <strong>Stay BEMed!</strong></p>\n"

So how did we end up with this particular project?</p>\n<p>In September 2014, while preparing the presentation for my talk at the <a href=\"https://ru.bem.info/talks/bemup-spb-2014/\">BEMup in St. Petersburg</a>, I was going through  the routine of taking screenshots of my favourite text editor to insert images with highlighted code samples.</p>\n<p>Then I found that my default dark-colour theme didn&#39;t go well with the slides. I had to re-take the screenshot, this time with a different colour scheme. Sometimes I&#39;d get a GUI element inside the frame of the screenshot, and then I&#39;d have to start over. Other times I&#39;d spot an error, and... well, you get the idea :)</p>\n<p>Clearly, that wasn&#39;t the best way to proceed, so I started looking for a ready-made solution. I needed something where I could just CTRL + C a snippet of code, then CTRL + V it into a form, choose a theme to go with it, then download the resulting pic sized to match the original code snippet.</p>\n<p>When I learned about the hackathon, I invited Alex <a href=\"https://github.com/rndD\">@rndD</a> to take part, and he accepted. We knocked around a few ideas, and in the end opted for the image service one.</p>\n<h2 id=\"preparation\"><a href=\"#preparation\" class=\"anchor\"></a>Preparation</h2>\n<p>We were both 100 percent confident that together we&#39;d be able to do everything and launch the service within the available timeframe.</p>\n<p>To get all the boring stuff out of the way, we did some preliminary work ahead of the hackathon:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>registered the domain name <a href=\"http://src2img.com\">src2img.com</a>;</li>\n<li>set up a virtual machine on DigitalOcean;</li>\n<li>created a repository called <a href=\"https://github.com/team411/src2img\">team411/src2img</a>;</li>\n<li>configured DNS;</li>\n<li>put up a placeholder.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Initially we weren&#39;t sure whether we&#39;d be needing a back end or not, so we were going to use phantom.js on the server for screenshot drawing.</p>\n<p>Aside from that, we were planning to use the standard BEM stack: <a href=\"https://ru.bem.info/tools/bem/enb-bem-examples/\">enb</a>, <a href=\"https://en.bem.info/libs/bem-core/v2.5.0/\">bem-core</a>, <a href=\"https://en.bem.info/libs/bem-components/v2/\">bem-components</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/15583/44214498.bc/0_9bbd7_63e86f23_XL.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"our-hackathon-tasks\"><a href=\"#our-hackathon-tasks\" class=\"anchor\"></a>Our hackathon tasks</h2>\n<p>There weren&#39;t that many tasks. We wanted to implement the basic functionality described above.</p>\n<p>We decided that we might throw in some additional features and enhancements if someone else joined our team at the hackathon.</p>\n<p>And hooray — we were indeed joined by two more people, namely Dima (<a href=\"https://github.com/corpix\">@corpix</a>) and Misha (<a href=\"https://github.com/restrry\">@restrry</a>)!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/15595/44214498.bc/0_9bbf9_f5dae655_XL.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"working-on-the-project\"><a href=\"#working-on-the-project\" class=\"anchor\"></a>Working on the project</h2>\n<p>We started by researching the subject and finding out that the basic functionality could be made to work without a back end (thanks to the <a href=\"https://github.com/niklasvh/html2canvas\">html2canvas</a> library!) To verify that conclusion, in just half an hour we created a working prototype in jsFiddle.</p>\n<p>Since we now had four people in the team, we shared the tasks between us:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Misha and I worked on the client blocks;</li>\n<li>Alex finished the build and deployed the end result to our server;</li>\n<li>Dima helped a lot with the build and the static resources freeze, and after that he went and made his own experimental back end in Python, which he used to render BEMHTML templates.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Along the way we encountered some serious problems with the project generator <a href=\"https://github.com/bem/generator-bem-stub\">generator-bem-stub</a>, which, despite all the set options, generated an awful lot of errors in BH templates and didn&#39;t build the entire CSS or JS even for standard blocks from bem-components. We had to delete everything and download the ready-made project-stub. That set us back two or three hours.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/17918/44214498.bc/0_9bbf8_d81430b0_XL.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"results\"><a href=\"#results\" class=\"anchor\"></a>Results</h2>\n<p>By the end of the hackathon we&#39;d done everything we&#39;d set out to do, plus some bonus functionality thanks to the new team members.</p>\n<p>Here&#39;s what we had by the end:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>functional service — <a href=\"http://src2img.com\">src2img.com</a>;</li>\n<li>source files — <a href=\"https://github.com/team411/src2img\">src2img на github</a>;</li>\n<li>experimental Python-based back end  — <a href=\"https://github.com/team411/src2img-backend\">src2img-backend на github</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"impressions\"><a href=\"#impressions\" class=\"anchor\"></a>Impressions</h2>\n<p>I am delighted to have been able to take part in the hackathon. I am even more delighted by the fact that I had such cool people join my team, and that together we were able to carry out all of our plans. I couldn&#39;t have managed without them.</p>\n<p>I can&#39;t find any fault with anything related to the organization of the hackathon, so I&#39;ll just say thanks again to the organizers and my team.</p>\n<p>It was awesome! Let&#39;s hope this BEM hackathon was just the first of many!</p>\n<p><strong>Stay BEMed!</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/15565/44214498.bd/0_9bc30_a0c39994_XL.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n"

Moscow, Saint-Petersburg, Kiev, Minsk, Riga, Amsterdam. Ya.Subbotnik, YaC, RIT, WebConf, Fronteers.</p>\n<p>Very soon indeed we will open up a new part of the world for us, new country, new experience area. We are going to talk about BEM at <a href=\"http://metarefresh.in/2013/\">Meta Refresh 2013</a> in India that will take place in Bangalore on Feb 22-23, 2013.</p>\n<p>Meta Refresh is a conference on the construction of user experience on the web. It&#39;s one of the biggest front-end conference in South-East Asia that brought together more than 20 tech talks last year that were dedicated to practical experience of tools and technologies.</p>\n<p>The 2013 edition is about letting go. It’s about learning the skills necessary to build experiences which cannot possibly exist in any medium apart from the internet. The conference is about to bring together professionals not only from South-East Asia but from Australia, USA, Switzerland. Conference will showcase people who have a deep understanding of what the internet is and what it can be: people who have built experiences and can tell you what they have learnt.</p>\n<p>BEM team will be among them. In her presentation Varya Stepanova will talk about our way of front-end development, how and for what reasons BEM was created, why BEM way of development, in our point of view, is the easiest and cheapest way, what are the benefits of BEM development.</p>\n<p>While preparing for the conference we publish material that might be interesting and useful to you: <a href=\"https://en.bem.info/tutorials/start-with-project-stub/\">Starting your own BEM project</a>.</p>\n<p>Video preview that we were asked to make while preparing to Meta Refresh 2013.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nrn1fH69PGk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<p>Varya Stepanova is a front-end engineer working for Yandex in Moscow since 2008. She is the Lead Developer of the UI Framework Team which provides HTML, CSS and Javascript components used to build over 100 different Yandex services. She participates in the BEM project (<a href=\"https://en.bem.info\">https://en.bem.info</a>) which is open-sourcing technologies behind Yandex UI framework.

Also there may be other reasons such as lack of root privileges.</p>\n<p>We also recommend you <a href=\"https://en.bem.info/tools/bem/bem-tools/installation/\">to install bem-tools locally</a> with <code>npm i bem</code>\nto prevent conflicts with other BEM projects.</p>\n<p>Locally installed bem can seem inconvenient to use. You have to run bem from project root, typing the full path to the\nbin/bem script <code>./node_modules/.bin/bem make</code>. You may also create a symbolic link <code>ln -s ./node_modules/.bin/bem</code>\nand run it like this <code>./bem</code> or add the path of your local <code>./node_modules/.bin</code> directory to the environment\nvariable <code>PATH</code>.

            "body": "\n<p>Hi everyone!</p>\n<p>My name is <a href=\"https://en.bem.info/authors/grinenko-vladimir/\">Volodya Grinenko</a>, I live in Simferopol, I am the head of the BEM Development service, I write code 24/7, love my wife and don&#39;t like meat. You can find lots of my BEM talks at this <a href=\"https://events.yandex.ru/lib/people/68132/\">link</a>.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s now my turn to share my thoughts and impressions of the <a href=\"https://ru.bem.info/events/bem-hackaton-2014/\">BEM hackathon</a> that we held last November in Moscow.</p>\n<p>I&#39;m not one to wax lyrical, but our &quot;first outing&quot; has left some fond memories, not least of the  great turnout, with people from different cities coming to spend a weekend with the BEM team at our own hackathon.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/15556/44214498.bb/0_9bbbe_e6ea69b_XL.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"why-did-we-do-it\"><a href=\"#why-did-we-do-it\" class=\"anchor\"></a>Why did we do it?</h2>\n<p>The BEM team spent a lot of last year getting to know people from the community. That involved a lot of online communication, conferences and BEMups, where we all met, chatted and discussed our experience.</p>\n<p>At one point we realized that the simple talk format was no longer enough. People were trying their hand at their own projects and facing some real problems in the process. Where possible, we gave online assistance via messengers and forums. But that wasn&#39;t enough.</p>\n<p>As far as live events were concerned, we were gradually moving from talks to master classes. When the increase in the developers&#39; level became evident, we had an idea to conduct a <a href=\"http://ru.bem.info/talks/bemup-spb-2014/#Мастер-класс-наоборот:-вы-пишете-БЭМ-проект,-а-мы-подсказываем-—-Евгений-Константинов,-Дима-Белицкий,-Яндекс\">master class in reverse</a>, where BEMup participants carried out assignments under our guidance.</p>\n<p>We saw that many enjoyed &quot;on the spot&quot; coding and were good at it. Why not then have a bash at a BEM hackathon? We seemed to be equal to the task, as challenging as it was — the team had grown and were ready to present projects and answer questions, our Yandex colleagues were keen to take part and help us with our teams, and there was already a sufficient number of developers &quot;from the outside&quot; with the necessary skill level, creating their own BEM projects.</p>\n<p>So it was settled. We recorded a <iframe src=\"//video.yandex.ru/iframe/ya-events/?player-type=custom&amp;show-info=false&amp;show-logo=false&amp;hd=1\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> and it was off from there! </p>\n<p>The next few months were spent in preparation: we had to find people to lead the projects, decide what those projects would be, select participants for the hackathon, help some of them get to Moscow. There was a lot of work involved but I think we managed. \n<img src=\"https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/15516/44214498.bd/0_9bc04_fe943d27_XL.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"why-hackathons-are-good\"><a href=\"#why-hackathons-are-good\" class=\"anchor\"></a>Why hackathons are good</h2>\n<p>All the details of the project presentations, of people forming teams, working hard, not sleeping, eating pizzas and presenting their project results at the end have already been covered by other participants in their post-hackathon posts. So I&#39;m going to talk about something else.</p>\n<p>What were those two days like? The participants gave different descriptions: strenuous, fun, interesting, enlightening, exhausting. The main answer though is that they were productive! There was not a project that didn&#39;t make it to the end. Some people may not have been able to achieve their original goals but everyone did their best.</p>\n<p>Our hackathon took place in a very friendly atmosphere. Everyone already knew each other either from the BEMups or through previous online communication. Participants didn&#39;t hesitate to offer assistance to or seek advice from members of &quot;rival&quot; teams. \nI am not sure if that was because our chosen event format didn&#39;t imply competition as such or because the event attracted the right kind of people or  if it&#39;s just the way BEM influences people :) It&#39;s something that everyone can judge for themselves.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-did-we-all-get-out-of-the-hackathon\"><a href=\"#what-did-we-all-get-out-of-the-hackathon\" class=\"anchor\"></a>What did we all get out of the hackathon?</h2>\n<p>I believe first of all it was the drive to push on and grow further professionally. Working alongside smart and determined people as one team, realizing that you&#39;ve managed able to create a product together, small as it may be, within a short period of time — all of that drives you and spurs you on and pushes you to keep learning and growing further.</p>\n<p>Secondly, result-oriented teamwork is a great motivator. Somewhere in the dark corners of your soul your own conscience begins to hint how your performance during regular work hours could perhaps be improved :)</p>\n<p>Thirdly, a hackathon brings people closer. Before, we&#39;d been staying in contact, exchanging emails, retweeting each other&#39;s messages but rarely meeting in real life. The hackathon let us put faces to names. Some people made friends, some people started projects together :) One way or another, that was a big step forward for the community.</p>\n<p>I could go on and give you a &quot;forthly&quot;, a &quot;fifthly&quot; and so on, up to &quot;tenthly&quot;. The important thing, though, is that everyone who took part in the event had their own wonderful and exciting journey and enriched their life experience!</p>\n<h2 id=\"not-empty-handed-or-the-bem-blog-project\"><a href=\"#not-empty-handed-or-the-bem-blog-project\" class=\"anchor\"></a>Not empty-handed, or the BEM Blog project</h2>\n<p>Incidentally, I came to the hackathon with a project of my own. I planned to finish a BEM stack-based blog, which I&#39;d begun to write during the <a href=\"https://ru.bem.info/events/campjs-melbourne-2014/\">Camp JS</a> conference in Australia when we were staying for a couple of days at a camp with no Internet connection.</p>\n<p>I wasn&#39;t able to get a team together, people found other projects more interesting :) However, I didn&#39;t drop the project altogether, and did a bit of coding now and then in between consulting other teams.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/15565/44214498.bc/0_9bbec_203e98f4_XL.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>My project was about creating a full-blown engine on which you could deploy a small website using the full BEM technology stack, in a way that should be no more difficult to do than by using WordPress. Both file system based markdown files and a database of some sort could be used as data sources. Themes were to be provided by a redefinition level containing BEMTREE and BEMHTML templates, CSS and JS.</p>\n<p>I was aiming for a product that could be used in two modes: as a static page generator to avoid the need to search for specialized hosting supporting Node.js, and as a dynamic application.</p>\n<h2 id=\"results\"><a href=\"#results\" class=\"anchor\"></a>Results</h2>\n<p>So what was I able to achieve before and during the hackathon? Currently the blog can generate pages from markdown format.</p>\n<p>Obviously, I&#39;m still a long way away from the product I would like to see in the end. And if I do manage to make time for further development, I&#39;m most likely to rewrite the existing code pretty much from scratch ;)</p>\n<p>However, those wishing to collaborate with me on the project are more than welcome to join!</p>\n<p>The project description can be found in the <a href=\"https://github.com/tadatuta/bb/\">repository</a>.</p>\n<p>Further plans for the project are presented on <a href=\"https://github.com/tadatuta/bb/wiki\">wiki</a>.</p>\n<p>Let&#39;s code the blog together and stay all a little bit <strong>BEMed</strong>!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/15538/44214498.be/0_9bc46_64c50266_XL.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n"

            "body": "\n<p>Hi!</p>\n<p>Currently bem-tools development is in freeze state.</p>\n<p>We smooothly migrate to <a href=\"http://enb-make.info/\">ENB</a>. ENB is an alternative implementation of <code>bem make</code> command. It does not support other commands. Besides, ENB core allows building projects not connected to BEM. ENB as well as bem-tools has most of its logic in technologies (techs) modules.</p>\n<p>Because of the fact that ENB core does not know anything about BEM, it has no default behavior, and it makes its configs more verbose however they become easier to read.</p>\n<p>One of the main reasons for migration to ENB was the fact that most of the developers at Yandex moved to ENB when it was born and builded typical projects faster than bem-tools. Afterwards Marat Dulin who authored ENB helped us to fasten bem-tools (it has happened then v2-technologies appeared) but there was already no reason to move back.</p>\n<p>As a result we had a choice: to support both instruments, test all blocks build by both, answer questions about both and sync changes in both places or to choose just one. We decided to follow the majority.</p>\n<p>By now we implemented everything that was developed on top of bem-tools for ENB and added parts that ENB did not have.</p>\n<p>We planned more to do such as writing and publishing new modules documentation, release libraries built with ENB, support it in <a href=\"https://en.bem.info/tutorials/project-stub/\">project-stub</a> and so on.</p>\n<p>Talking about usage, until bem-core@v3 is out it will be possible to build all of our libraries with any of building tools. There will be no difference in resulting state. When there are changes coming, we will inform you immediately via our blog here on <a href=\"https://en.bem.info/blog\">bem.info</a>.</p>\n<p>For tasks such as entities creation bem-tools are still actual. There is no sense in implementing such logic in ENB. It is possible that in the frames of bem-tools <code>make</code> command will be polymorphic: if there is bem-tools config — we build with <code>bem make</code>, if there is ENB config — we build with ENB.</p>\n<p>As we already told monay times on BEMup&#39;s, we have frozen bem-tools 1.0 development, however we continue to dream about a number of atomic modules that will allow building BEM-projects on grunt, gulp, broccoli, brunch, etc.</p>\n<p>Someday we will get there. Or may be find somebody passionate from BEM community to do so, may we not?</p>\n<p>If you have time and desire to tackle this task, we will be happy to discuss it, help to plan and advise, where to move first, and the longer it takes the more we are open to engage you in sharing results on our own or external conferences and publish it on bem.info.</p>\n<p>Email us at <a href=\"mailto:info@bem.info\">info@bem.info</a></p>\n<p><strong>Stay BEMed!</strong></p>\n"

            "body": "\n<p>Hi!</p>\n<p>We are frequently asked about what do we mean by “technologies” in BEM, what kind of them we have, how do they work and so on. Let us explain :)</p>\n<h2 id=\"definition-of-technology-techs\"><a href=\"#definition-of-technology-techs\" class=\"anchor\"></a>Definition of “technology” (techs)</h2>\n<p>While writing about BEM we use two terms to define technology — “tech” and “technology”. Do not be afraid of that :) Is there any difference? There is none. However, there are plenty of technologies in BEM, and not to be mistaken or misunderstood, let us sort them through to you.</p>\n<p>When we write “tech” or “technology”, we usually mean the following:</p>\n<p>First of all, common web-technologies that are used to implement behavior or appearance of the blocks, elements and modifiers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>CSS for appearance;</li>\n<li>JavaScript implementation for dynamic behavior;</li>\n<li>templates (XSL, TT2, JavaScript, etc.) that convert page declaration into HTML-code;</li>\n<li>images related to BEM entity;</li>\n<li>documentation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For instance, when we have my-block.css file that declares block appearance, we say that block was implemented using CSS technology.</p>\n<p>Second of all, we have a number of own technologies — (<a href=\"https://en.bem.info/technology/bemhtml/current/reference/\">BEMHTML</a>, <a href=\"https://en.bem.info/technology/bemtree/current/bemtree/\">BEMTREE</a>, <a href=\"https://en.bem.info/technology/bemjson/current/bemjson/\">BEMJSON</a>, <a href=\"https://en.bem.info/tutorials/bem-js-tutorial/\">i-bem.js</a>) that are our implementation of <a href=\"https://en.bem.info/method/\">BEM methodology</a>.</p>\n<p>Thirdly, there are “<a href=\"https://en.bem.info/tools/bem/bem-tools/tech-modules/\">tech modules</a>” — files that are used by building tools such as bem-tools or ENB to build bundles.</p>\n<p>Fourthly, we use <a href=\"https://en.bem.info/tools/optimizers/borschik/\">borschik</a> that rely on its own building technologies.</p>\n<p>Thus, depending on a context we can mean something from up above saying “tech” or “technology” or use it as a collective sense: “space technology”, “BEM technology”.</p>\n<p>We hope we cleared that up for you. Let us move on.</p>\n<h2 id=\"site-navigation-improvement-technologies-section\"><a href=\"#site-navigation-improvement-technologies-section\" class=\"anchor\"></a>Site navigation improvement, “Technologies” section</h2>\n<p>From now on everything about technologies listed in the second paragraph will appear in our new section called “<a href=\"https://en.bem.info/technology/\">Technologies</a>” on bem.info. We set it up to ease in our point of view a life of users and make navigation on site be more native and understandable. Related information about BEMHTML, BEMTREE, BEMJSON and i-bem.js we group according to <a href=\"https://en.bem.info/libs/bem-core/\">bem-core</a> libraries versions.</p>\n<p>Besides the new section “Technologies” on site we have made some more changes.</p>\n<p>We deleted outdated versions of bem-core library documentation in the “Libraries” section, because it was not covering everything, and added subparagraph called “Documentation”. It leads us on click to the page with tags selection corresponding with the selected version of the chosen library.</p>\n<h2 id=\"publishing-at-beminfo\"><a href=\"#publishing-at-beminfo\" class=\"anchor\"></a>Publishing at bem.info</h2>\n<p>We also checked “Tutorials” and “Articles” sections. First now gathers materials about how to do something step by step, containing instructions or practical knowledge. Second will contain more common materials about BEM including those that are written not by our team but by BEM-community developers including those that were published in some place else.</p>\n<p>If you know such articles and think they might be handy to be published at bem.info; moreover, you wrote such articles by yourself and want them to be published here — email us at <a href=\"mailto:info@bem.info\">info@bem.info</a>, and we will be happy to do so.</p>\n<p>If you notice a mistake, 404 or know how to improve usability on the site, do not stay silent, our mailbox <a href=\"mailto:info@bem.info\">info@bem.info</a> is waiting for your emails!</p>\n<p><strong>Stay BEMed!</strong></p>\n"

            "body": "\n<p>Greetings, dear reader!</p>\n<p>My name is Sasha Belyanskii. I work in the Group of advertising technologies, in Simferopol. In addition to my regular job of developing interfaces for Yandex.Direct, I devote my time to nurturing and developing <a href=\"https://en.bem.info/authors/harisov-vitaly/\">Vitaly Harisov</a>&#39;s ideas about how <strong>source code editors&#39; usability can be improved</strong> by ”teaching“ them to work with BEM projects.</p>\n<p>I want to share my impressions of the recently held BEM hackathon, tell you about my own idea, the team-that-never-was, my project plans, and why I decided not to waste my time and help other people.</p>\n<h2 id=\"about-me-and-my-project\"><a href=\"#about-me-and-my-project\" class=\"anchor\"></a>About me and my project</h2>\n<p>As mentioned above, I work in the Group of advertising technologies in Simferopol, developing interfaces for Yandex.Direct, doing front-end development and JavaScript programming.</p>\n<p>The BEM community knows me as the developer who talks about the BEM IDE prototype idea. What idea is that then?</p>\n<p>The BEM methodology is a powerful tool for the development of large-scale projects. Dividing an interface into separate entities helps identify the general and the specific, but, like everything else in this world, BEM is not perfect. It&#39;s easy to get confused while working on a big BEM project, as the logic for a single block can be described at different redefinition levels.</p>\n<p>BEM IDE is about developing plug-ins for different source code editors that should make working with BEM projects easy and straightforward without changing your customary environment. To get a better idea of the whole concept, see this <a href=\"https://events.yandex.ru/lib/talks/2197/\">video</a> of the BEMup in Saint Petersburg.</p>\n<p>When the chance came up for me to be a mentor at a BEM hackathon and tackle the BEM IDE project idea as a team effort by writing plug-ins for code editors, I jumped at it.</p>\n<p>For the hackathon, I already had a completed BEM IDE prototype and a general understanding of the principle of working with a block&#39;s code at all levels at once. I chose Atom and Brackets as source code editors in which to implement the capabilities provided by the prototype, as they are both written in JavaScript and have an accessible API, which I began to study. As for the more popular WebStorm and Sublime Text, those were left to be dealt with during the hackathon.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/16110/44214498.bb/0_9bbbf_af7a297b_XL.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"in-the-field\"><a href=\"#in-the-field\" class=\"anchor\"></a>In the field</h2>\n<p>The first day of the hackathon began with the project presentations, where the mentors had to pitch their ideas to the participants and try to recruit people into their teams.</p>\n<p>How did I get on? I am not exactly a master of eloquence but that was only half the problem, it seems... Even before the presentation, I came to the important realization that coming to a hackathon — where everyone&#39;s looking forward to coding blocks — with a project that has nothing to do with block-coding is always a bit of a gamble. There&#39;s a great chance you&#39;ll fail to get a team together.</p>\n<p>That&#39;s precisely what happened. After the presentations, the developers chose to join other, more practical projects, which, in one way or another, involved working with blocks, documentation or the bem.info site.</p>\n<p>So my project had to be backburnered. I felt disappointed, but working on my own, I wouldn&#39;t be bringing much value to the hackathon. So I decided to continue working on BEM IDE after the hackathon and publish the results in a separate article on <a href=\"https://en.bem.info/articles/\">bem.info</a>.</p>\n<p>And in the meantime I could put my expertise and my time to good use as a team member on a different project — so I went and joined <a href=\"https://en.bem.info/authors/abramov-andrey/\">Andrey</a>&#39;s &quot;modular build&quot; project.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/15498/44214498.bc/0_9bbee_6149623c_XL.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"build\"><a href=\"#build\" class=\"anchor\"></a>Build?</h2>\n<p>Andrey&#39;s idea consisted in making the build process for BEM projects transparent by breaking it down into modules that could be used indepedently of the existing build systems such as <a href=\"https://ru.bem.info/tools/bem/enb-bem-examples/\">ENB</a> or <a href=\"https://en.bem.info/tools/bem/bem-tools/\">bem-tools</a>. I was not that clued up on the inner workings of the build tools, so I was just trying to take in what my more knowledgeable team mates had to say on the matter.</p>\n<p>Towards the first day&#39;s evening we&#39;d gone through the plans for what&#39;s required to build a BEM project using Gulp and got down to work. We went on to develop a number of modules during the hackathon, with bem-walker becoming Andrey&#39;s own pride and joy.</p>\n<p>However, an important part was still missing — we didn&#39;t have a module for building an accurate dependency list that the build tool was supposed to use. We were looking into how the deps-resolver module in the ENB build tool was implemented but it turned out to be rather complex, and we had no time for a re-write. Instead we did our best to upgrade it to meet our needs, so that we had at least a build prototype to show at the end of the hackathon.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/16115/44214498.bc/0_9bbed_a19cf4db_XL.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"team-results-and-overall-impressions\"><a href=\"#team-results-and-overall-impressions\" class=\"anchor\"></a>Team results and overall impressions</h2>\n<p>The hackathon concluded with another series of project presentations, this time with the mentors reporting on their teams&#39; results.</p>\n<p>Andrey presented the finished modules, stressing their benefits, before proceeding to explain how the modular approach brings the future that much closer and mentioning the almost working gulp-based build.</p>\n<p>But so much for spoilers. You&#39;ll soon be able to read Andrey&#39;s own detailed post and see the team results published.</p>\n<p>Following the presentations, the participants were able to each vote for their favourite project, and after the votes were counted, the lovely event organizers awarded books and t-shirts to the top three winning teams.</p>\n<p>For me personally, it was great getting to see the results delivered by all the teams after two days of shoulder-to-shoulder collaboration. It was an excellent experience and the first event of this kind in the BEM community!</p>\n<p>The organizers did a tremendous job making sure we felt comfortable at all times. We enjoyed comfortable workspaces, great food and a wonderful atmosphere.</p>\n<p>The highlights for me personally? Being an interfaces developer who finds himself writing blocks all the time, it was interesting for me to watch colleagues at work, those who routinely develop with node.js. I realized, for example, how programming modules could be made easier if you first write the tests and then the code :)</p>\n<p>And, of course, events like this are not just about the coding but about the atmosphere, too!</p>\n<p>A weekend spent in the company of like-minded people, topped off with an afterparty is the very sort of diversion that puts the wind in your sails and keeps you working with renewed vigour and in high spirits for a long time afterwards :)</p>\n<p>Make no mistake, dear reader — events like this inflict beneficial results and cause severe enjoyment!</p>\n<p>And all the  subsequent participant reviews only serve to make these events better and better :)</p>\n<p>That&#39;s all, keep coding and <strong>Stay BEMed</strong>!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/15493/44214498.bd/0_9bc1a_178d2a58_XL.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n"

            "body": "\n<p>Hi,</p>\n<p>My name is <a href=\"https://en.bem.info/authors/abramov-andrey/\">Andrey Abramov</a>. At Yandex, I work on the development of BEM tools, most of which are build tools for projects based on the BEM methodology.</p>\n<p>It was my first hackathon, and already I was attending as a mentor. That, on the one hand, entailed a certain responsibility, but on the other hand, made for a special experience, which I&#39;d like to tell you about.</p>\n<p>My area of work at Yandex necessarily influenced my choice of project for the hackathon. As well as that, I was driven by a burning desire to make the world a better place. Read on to see how it all worked out.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/16138/44214498.bb/0_9bbc7_29c1a57a_XL.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"background\"><a href=\"#background\" class=\"anchor\"></a>Background</h2>\n<p>Building projects is one of the tasks that just about every BEM developer has to deal with.</p>\n<p>BEM has two build tools in its arsenal — good old bem-tools and ENB, complete with multiple packages and extensions. Both solutions are supported and are functional.</p>\n<p>Yet they both have one drawback — they lack simplicity.</p>\n<p>Besides, every user project is unique in its own way, which inevitably means that standard solutions will never suffice. Users will have to customize existing solutions to meet their own specific needs.</p>\n<p>The conclusion that comes to mind then is that, firstly, build tools must be simple enough so that anyone can understand how to use them, and secondly, they must be flexible so that specific user tasks can be accomplished by creating dedicated plug-ins.</p>\n<h2 id=\"modular-build\"><a href=\"#modular-build\" class=\"anchor\"></a>Modular build</h2>\n<p>The above considerations lead to the idea of making the build process easier both in terms of understanding and in terms of development. That was the idea I brought to the hackathon as the mentor of the Build team.</p>\n<p>To put this idea into practice, I thought we needed a set of principles for the development of tools, which must be followed to perform the tasks set.</p>\n<p>After the word ”pain“ came up three times in my presentation, as I spoke of my experience of using and developing the current solutions, I went on to list the principles that would prevent that word from being uttered again.</p>\n<p>Here&#39;s what I came up with:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>One module per task.</li>\n<li>Simple API.\nAn API helps users accomplish specific tasks, so it should interact in terms of those tasks and not through a set of its own abstractions.</li>\n<li>Plug-ins.\nA module allows variation in the way the task is accomplished without having to rewrite the module.</li>\n<li>Specification.\nThe module&#39;s architecture allows for full test coverage of the code.</li>\n<li>Abstracting the file system.\nIf the module&#39;s job is not directly related to the file system, the module should be able to operate without it.</li>\n<li>Compatibility.\nThe idea was to develop modules that could be used with a variety of tools: bem-tools, ENB, gulp, grunt, broccoli, etc.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"the-team\"><a href=\"#the-team\" class=\"anchor\"></a>The team</h2>\n<p>I wasn&#39;t expecting many people to join my team after the presentation, given\nthe nature of the project. Fortunately, my concerns proved ill-founded, as I found myself in a team of four. Each team member made his own valuable contribution to the end result.</p>\n<p>Our team:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://events.yandex.ru/lib/people/610407/\">Sasha Belyanskii</a> (@belyanskii) works in the Yandex.Direct team in the Simferopol office; presented the <a href=\"https://en.bem.info/blog/first-bem-ide/\">BEM IDE</a> project at the hackathon, but ended up with us once the teams were formed. Sasha&#39;s bem.info profile can be found <a href=\"https://en.bem.info/authors/belyanskii-alexandr/\">here</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://events.yandex.ru/lib/people/9466/\">Vsevolod Strukchinskii</a> (@floatdrop) works in the Yandex office in Yekaterinburg and is the author of <a href=\"http://github.com/floatdrop/gulp-bem\">gulp-bem</a> and maintainer of <a href=\"http://getbem.com\">getbem.com</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://events.yandex.ru/lib/people/423628/\">Evgeniy Gavryushin</a> (@egavr) works on tools development in the Yandex office in Simferopol and is the author of <code>generator-bem-stub</code>. Evgeniy&#39;s bem.info profile can be seen <a href=\"https://en.bem.info/authors/gavryushin-evgeny/\">here</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"planning\"><a href=\"#planning\" class=\"anchor\"></a>Planning</h2>\n<p>Unlike most other mentors&#39; plans, my plan consisted of just two items:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Come up with a plan.</li>\n<li>Proceed according to plan.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So the first thing we did was book a conference room and have a several-hour discussion about what tasks each of us considered to be main priority and how they should be done.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/16115/44214498.bc/0_9bbed_a19cf4db_XL.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I was pleased to find that every team member had his own experience of building projects.</p>\n<p>For example, Sasha told us how modules could be used in his BEM IDE prototype, while Vsevolod offered many fine ideas already used in <code>gulp-bem</code>. As for myself and Evgeniy, we had a good understanding of how modules could be used in the ENB packages.</p>\n<p>The discussion generated a list of tasks deemed to be the most important ones:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Scanning block levels.\nTo find out what BEM entities there are in the project, in which redefinition levels and technologies they are implemented.</li>\n<li>Identifying dependencies.\nThe possibility to add missing dependencies to declarations of BEM entities in a required order.</li>\n<li>Reading fiels in the <code>deps.js</code> technology.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We jotted down a to-do list and decided that the best way to demonstrate how modules work was to create a build prototype using <code>gulp</code>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/15517/44214498.bc/0_9bbf0_4f398d3a_XL.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"development\"><a href=\"#development\" class=\"anchor\"></a>Development</h2>\n<p>We had set ourselves ambitious plans, but the schedule was quite tight. To minimize the risks of a debacle in such a non-standard situation, we had to act with determination.</p>\n<p>We discussed the architecture of modules and the requirements list until everyone was in agreement as to what needed to be done in each specific case. Only then did we start pounding away at the keyboard.</p>\n<p>That way code was written at the first attempt and only once. We didn&#39;t need to waste time rewriting modules because of misunderstood tasks or lack of coordination within the team.</p>\n<h3 id=\"test-driven-development\"><a href=\"#test-driven-development\" class=\"anchor\"></a>Test-driven development</h3>\n<p>Just agreeing on the modules&#39; structure was not enough though, we also had to capture those decisions. So we decided we would write tests first and then code.</p>\n<p>That helped us verify our decisions as to how each module should work in the trickiest of cases, as well as capturing what we were looking to achieve in the process.</p>\n<p>The visibility of the progress was a pleasant bonus. The number of tests is known beforehand. You can see at any given moment how much work has been completed and how much still remains to be done. A growing number of ”green“ tests is an excellent motivating factor.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pair-programming\"><a href=\"#pair-programming\" class=\"anchor\"></a>Pair programming</h3>\n<p>As you will remember, we&#39;d planned four tasks originally, and there were four of us in the team.</p>\n<p>Time was tight, so it seemed reasonable to take on a task each and get on with the coding. But our experience told us that it was impossible to run in every direction and that quality might suffer in the end.</p>\n<p>We decided to adopt the best traditions of extreme programming and split into pairs. Each subteam took on a task and worked on it until all the tests passed. The rest of the team then reviewed the result, made their own suggestions and corrections and considered how to link the modules.</p>\n<p>The difficulty of staying focused while keeping up the same thinking mode during the day was another reason for adopting pair programming. That way if you were tired of thinking in terms of architecture of algorithms, you could take over the &quot;pilot&quot; role, write code, concentrate on the code syntax and more local solutions. And vice versa, if you got tired of tippety-tapping on the keyboard with your eyes glued to the screen, you assumed the role of navigator guiding &quot;the pilot&quot;.</p>\n<p>To prevent communication gaps, people switched subteams upon completing a task.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mistakes-happen\"><a href=\"#mistakes-happen\" class=\"anchor\"></a>Mistakes happen</h3>\n<p>Implementing a module for identifying BEM dependencies in the absence of a specification can be a tricky task. And even porting the ENB solution according to the modular build principles proved fairly difficult.</p>\n<p>By the end of the second day it was clear that we didn&#39;t have time to develop the dependencies module into a viable working solution. So we decided to finish the prototype and write a small tool for handling BEM entity declarations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"results\"><a href=\"#results\" class=\"anchor\"></a>Results</h2>\n<p>After two days of hard work we had 4 modules ready.</p>\n<p>In the end none of them was perfect or could be used in real-life projects. But from a conceptual perspective, they are all beautiful! :)</p>\n<p>Here they are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bem/bem-walk\">bem-walk</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bem/bem-decl\">bem-decl</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/floatdrop/tech-deps.js\">tech-deps.js</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/belyanskii/deps-resolver\">deps-resolver</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Currently the projects are in active development and are not very stable.</p>\n<p>We&#39;ll be telling you about each of them separately as they are completed.</p>\n<p>And <a href=\"https://github.com/belyanskii/gulp-bem-stub\">this here</a> is what our <code>gulp</code>-based build prototype looks like.</p>\n<p>As always, your comments and suggestions for the projects are welcome on our <a href=\"https://ru.bem.info\">forum</a>.</p>\n<p>Build with ease and <strong>Stay BEMed</strong>!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/15493/44214498.bd/0_9bc1a_178d2a58_XL.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n"

I have been with Yandex since 2013, working as an interfaces developer (or front end developer, in common parlance). I&#39;m currently developing the bem.info site and BEM forum, I have knowledge of the full BEM stack and four years of experience in web development. My twitter name is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tavriaforever\">@tavriaforever</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.bem.info/authors/kuznetsov-andrey/\">Andrey Kuznecov</a> — my teammate at Yandex, interfaces developer, mostly on the server side which is developed with node.js. Has experience in server-side development using Java and Ruby. The times when Andrey first started to code already feature in history books. His twitter name is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kuznetsov48\">@kuznetsov48</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/mikeshukshin\">Mikhail Shukshin</a>, when he took part in the hackathon, was working as a front end developer in ”Sapato.ru“. As the mentor, I enjoyed working with Misha. He did really well. Without any hands-on experience of BEM stack development, he got stuck into the work right away and had no difficulty coding. A big thanks to him for the help, all the tasks that he planned were completed.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/voischev\">Ivan Voischev</a> — one of the most active BEM community members, came to the hackathon from Voronezh. Works in the web studio Manufactura. As the BEM evangelist of the company, Ivan managed to persuade his co-workers to switch to using the full BEM stack in website development. As far as I&#39;m aware, the studio benefited substantially from switching to the full BEM stack in terms of timelines and parallelizing tasks between server-side and client-side developement. Vanya got a difficult task at the hackathon. And he kept at it until the very end, passing through all the ”circles of hell“, which otherwise we would have had to face ourselves. So a big thanks to him for the help, our working together was just as fun as it was productive. Vanya&#39;s code will be used as the basis when the feature he worked on is brought up to production level.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://ru.bem.info/authors/vinogradov-anton/\">Anton Vinogradov</a>, interfaces developer in Alfa Lab&#39;s Moscow office. Works on the integration and development of the BEM methodology, having even adopted the BEM folder-naming conventions. Anton is an active member of the BEM community, a regular speaker at BEM events, and is developing a number of open-source BEM block libraries. With a lot of BEM stack development experience under his belt, he got down to working on the tasks at once, suggesting a number of improvements along the way. Together we discussed a lot of interesting aspects of BEM development. As the mentor, I&#39;m satisfied with the result. It&#39;s nice to know there are people like Anton and Vanya in the BEM community. Anton&#39;s twitter name is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AWinogradov\">@AWinogradov</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/yuri_malakhov\">Yuri Malakhov</a>, when he took part in the hackathon, was working in OOO Aitarget in Saint Petersburg. Experienced in both server-side and client-side development. Accomplished the set tasks at the hackathon. Yuri is a nice guy and good company, I enjoyed working with him.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/amel_true\">Andrei Melikhov</a>, works in the Yandex.Money department. He uses the full BEM stack in working on his service and is a confident coder with node.js. Together with Andrey Kuznecov, he developed the server solution for the forum. Andrei gave his 200 percent to the task, working tirelessly even through the night — a mighty big thanks to him for that, he&#39;s a real Yandexoid!</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/16142/44214498.bd/0_9bc1b_87f75ece_XL.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"getting-ready\"><a href=\"#getting-ready\" class=\"anchor\"></a>Getting ready</h2>\n<p>The BEM forum is a live, actively developing project on the bem.info site.</p>\n<p>We had no problem coming up with tasks. Typically, we have a lot of ideas and not enough resources to implement them. The only challenge was to organize the ”crowd coding process“.</p>\n<p>Andrey and I opted for the following arrangement: divide the tasklist into two categories — client-side-oriented and server-side-oriented tasks. After which we quizzed the team members on their individual strengths to find out who wanted to implement which feature.</p>\n<p>Tasks were then matched to people, and we got down to work.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-tasks\"><a href=\"#the-tasks\" class=\"anchor\"></a>The tasks</h2>\n<p>In the course of discussion we identified a number of separate tasks for every team member.</p>\n<p><strong>GitHub-like post sorting</strong></p>\n<p>Ever since the forum went live, the missing sorting functionality had been an issue. At the time GitHub already had its neatly implemented sorting function. We decided not to reinvent the wheel and follow GitHub&#39;s lead. So we used the block <code>select</code> from <a href=\"https://en.bem.info/libs/bem-components/v2/desktop/select/\">bem-components</a> and filled it with some JS magic to enable sorting by six different parameters.</p>\n<p><strong>Preview of .md code for posts and comments</strong></p>\n<p>The forum uses GitHub issues as a data source, where the content is written in markdown format, so we had it the same way. However, the preview feature was unavailable as the user wrote text and presented it in markdown blocks, which was rather inconvenient. We decided to implement markdown code preview during the hackathon and completed the task successfully. To do that, we used the BEM library <a href=\"https://github.com/awinogradov/bem-content\">bem-content</a>, which is a good library for content formatting. The library is maintained by <a href=\"http://ru.bem.info/authors/vinogradov-anton/\">Anton Vinogradov</a>, who was one of our team members.</p>\n<p><strong>Comment pagination</strong></p>\n<p>The number of users is growing by the day, and so is the number of posts and comments.  Pagination for comments had to be introduced, unless we wanted to see the user&#39;s page turn into a &quot;white skyscraper&quot;. That task was finished on time.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/15553/44214498.bc/0_9bbe6_58b11c4d_XL.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><strong>Implementing dynamic headers for posts</strong></p>\n<p>We were so engrossed with interface features that we completely forgot about one essential component — a unique page header for posts opened on separate pages.  We decided to implement that as well, even though we hadn&#39;t anticipated that we&#39;d be able to do that many tasks.</p>\n<p><strong>Post rating</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.bem.info/authors/grinenko-vladimir/\">Vladimir Grinenko</a> once suggested an idea for the rating of posts on the forum based on GitHub&#39;s emoji ”:+1“. It&#39;s a cool idea in that it&#39;ll help support post authors in different situations. We started to implement it at the hackathon but failed to estimate the task accurately. The work was already in progress when we realized how many possible conditions and exceptions must be taken into account when calculating a rating.\nUnfortunately, we failed to finish the task within the time constraints of the hackathon, but the massive amount of work we put in the task laid the groundwork for bringing it up to production level. We&#39;re looking to roll out the feature January — February 2015.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/15582/44214498.bc/0_9bbe8_d59e3acb_XL.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><strong>Authorization</strong></p>\n<p>While pondering over the forum database task, we struck upon the idea of adding another authorization option to the existing authorization through GitHub. To implement that functionality, we decided to use passport.js. It supports 140 providers. In addition to the server part, we had to work with the BEM stack as well as implement the user&#39;s panel for displaying information and the login/logout form. The task was successfully completed and handed over to Andrey and Yuri for subsequent use in the database task.</p>\n<p><strong>Database support using ORM as a data source</strong></p>\n<p>Andrey Kuznecov and Yuri Malakhov undertook the task concerned with an alternative data source for the forum, a database. For flexibility purposes, they decided not to tie their solution to a specific database but to use one of the node.js modules for interacting with different databases using ORM. To implement such as solution, they had to thoroughly revise the forum engine, perform code refactoring, allow for all the relevant data structure-related aspects and do a number of sub-tasks. The guys worked all day and all through the night sticking with their solution until the very end.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/15486/44214498.bc/0_9bbe5_bd4434f0_XL.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-team-at-work\"><a href=\"#the-team-at-work\" class=\"anchor\"></a>The team at work</h2>\n<p>As soon as the tasks were assigned, everyone started typing away at their laptops. Luckily, every team member had a MacBook, so no time was wasted on environment setup. Time was spent writing code, feeding off each other&#39;s good mood, discussing IT news, wishing Evgeniy Konstantinov <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sipayrt\">@sipayrt</a> a Happy Birthday, talking about BEM, putting up sticky notes for completed tasks on the board, preparing for the presentation, then everyone presenting the results and receiving prizes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"results\"><a href=\"#results\" class=\"anchor\"></a>Results</h2>\n<p>Both Andrey and I were really pleased with the results of this first BEM hackathon. We&#39;d hardly expected to produce so many lines of useful code.</p>\n<p>At the time of writing (January 2015), we have been able to release some of the solutions to production, onto the bem.info site. The time constraints of the hackathon didn&#39;t permit us to complete some of the more complicated and time-consuming tasks though, such as authorization via passport.js or using a database instead of GitHub for data storage.</p>\n<p>The guys had hardly slept, working on the code right up to the start of the project presentations. Their code will form a solid foundation for completing the task, and we will try to find the necessary resources to do this in 2015.</p>\n<p>That said, we did manage to complete the bulk of the tasks and get them to a production-ready state. We are very pleased about that.</p>\n<p>So what exactly did we finish and roll out?</p>\n<p>As you will have noticed, <strong>convenient post sorting</strong> has been enabled for the forum, which uses a select from bem-components. There are six available sorting options that you can choose from.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/15537/127846884.248/0_f7689_7e3f6956_XL.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>You can also see the <strong>preview</strong> of a post or comment that you are writing. This helps to ensure that the text is correct and is properly formatted.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/54/127846884.248/0_f7688_deed1eac_XL.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The finished feature for <strong>inserting headers</strong> for separate posts is already helping the forum make new friends via search engines. The home page can now be differentiated from specific post pages.</p>\n<p>The rest of the tasks are being finished, with the respective features shortly to be released. The features in question are comment pagination and post rating. Both features are high priority, and we&#39;ll be definitely using the code written by our team during the hackathon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"summary\"><a href=\"#summary\" class=\"anchor\"></a>Summary</h2>\n<p>We found the BEM hackathon to be a great format. The venue and the general atmosphere surrounding the hackathon participants were excellent. We were impressed with the attendees&#39; level, as well as the number of people full of enthusiasm for web development based on the BEM technical platform.</p>\n<p>I want to say thanks to my team. Well done to all of you, your solutions have contributed greatly to the main platform for BEM-related communication on the Internet.</p>\n<p>Exchange your thoughts and ideas, share solutions, and ask questions on the BEM forum. <strong>Stay BEMed!</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/15489/44214498.bd/0_9bc25_81384ed_XL.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n"

Because of the years of experience put in them while working in\nlarge rapidly changing services.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately it is very well known only here in Russia and ex-Soviet countries, where, thanks to Harry\nRoberts and Nicolas Gallagher, so-called BEM CSS is spread far ahead in the rest of the world. With this talk\nwe aim to share what we have in BEM Methodology to cover JS coding with and introduce Australian developers to\na new chapter in BEM, partly not always easy to understand, open-sourced and handy for maintaining complexity of\nweb development you could grow in.</p>\n<p><strong>Speaker&#39;s biography</strong></p>\n<p>Vladimir Grinenko is a web developer with more than 10 years of front-end experience and a deep expertise in\nHTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. He works for Yandex, Russian Search engine, and leads a team that develops BEM technologies.\nHe also evangelizes a lot both in Russian and English and gives live coding sessions as well as maintains\nand contributs to few opensource projects. His area of speaking experience includes such topics as BEM technologies,\nlarge scale web sites architecture, modular front-end applications development, etc.</p>\n<p>Follow <a href=\"http://twitter.com/bem_en\">@bem_en</a> for updates and live tweets.</p>\n<p>Hopefully, there will be video available after the conference that we can share with you.</p>\n<p><strong>Stay BEMed!</strong></p>\n"

When inheriting technologies all\nmodules in the chain should have the same version (the old modules shouldn&#39;t be mixed with the new ones).</p>\n<p>For moving to the new technologies one needs to declare them in the bundles file <code>.bem/level.js</code>, for example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-js\">exports.getTechs = function() {\n\n    return {\n        &#39;bemjson.js&#39;     : &#39;&#39;,\n        &#39;js&#39;             : &#39;v2/js-i&#39;,\n        &#39;bemdecl.js&#39;     : &#39;v2/bemdecl.js&#39;,\n        &#39;deps.js&#39;        : &#39;v2/deps.js&#39;,\n        &#39;i18n&#39;           : &#39;../bem-bl/blocks-common/i-bem/bem/techs/v2/i18n.js&#39;,\n        &#39;i18n.js&#39;        : &#39;../bem-bl/blocks-common/i-bem/bem/techs/v2/i18n.js.js&#39;,\n        &#39;css&#39;            : &#39;v2/css&#39;\n    };\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>The only difference in file paths for the old technology and the new one is the prefix <code>v2/</code> (see example above).</p>\n<p>This applies to technologies that are already included in bem-tools, and those in <a href=\"https://en.bem.info/libs/bem-bl/\">bem-bl</a>.\nThe old modules will work with the new version of bem-tools without any speed change.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/bem/bem-bl/tree/0.3\">bem-bl 0.3</a> already has everything necessary for using v2.</p>\n<p>There are some projects on which technologies by default aren&#39;t defined at the levels.\nIn this case the old version will be used.\nTo use version 2, one has to declare new technologies explicitly, as it was shown in the example above.</p>\n<p>When using the new technologies, extra acceleration can be achieved by caching levels of definition with blocks.</p>\n<p>If you&#39;re working on a project which uses bem-bl (or other blocks library), and you don&#39;t change\nthese blocks, but edit them at definition levels, then the building process can be set up so\nbem-bl will be read only once, and for the next builds the cache will be used.</p>\n<p>This can be done by using the following code in <code>.bem/make.js</code></p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-js\">MAKE.decl(&#39;Arch&#39;, {\n    getLevelCachePolicy: function() {\n        return {\n                cache: false,\n                except: [&#39;bem-bl&#39;]\n        }\n    }\n\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here <code>cache:false</code> says that by default levels cache is off.</p>\n<p><code>except</code> is an array of levels paths (or directories containing levels) treated as exceptions,\ne.g. in this case the cache is enabled.</p>\n<p>The cache will be regenerated if the build was run with the option <code>--force</code>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-changes-in-api\"><a href=\"#the-changes-in-api\" class=\"anchor\"></a>The changes in API</h2>\n<h3 id=\"1-settings-for-your-own-technology-to-use-the-new-api\"><a href=\"#1-settings-for-your-own-technology-to-use-the-new-api\" class=\"anchor\"></a>1. Settings for your own technology to use the new API</h3>\n<p>To allow your technology to use the new API you need to export the property API_VER:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-js\">exports.API_VER = 2;\n\nexports.techMixin = {\n\n...\n\n};\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"2-file-extension-suffix-settings-for-its-working-technology\"><a href=\"#2-file-extension-suffix-settings-for-its-working-technology\" class=\"anchor\"></a>2. File extension (suffix) settings for its working technology</h3>\n<p>In the old technologies to specify the suffix, which and from which the technology will\nconstruct the result, the methods <code>getSuffixes()</code> and <code>getBuildSuffixes()</code> were used.\nIn the new version it&#39;s possible to use the same methods,\nbut for better flexibility and understanding it&#39;s preferable to use <code>getBuildSuffixesMap()</code>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-js\">{\n    getBuildSuffixesMap: function() {\n        return {\n            &#39;ie.css&#39;: [&#39;ie.css&#39;, &#39;ie.hover.css&#39;];\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this example we say that we built the file <code>ie.css</code> from the files <code>ie.css</code> and <code>ie.hover.css</code>.\nThe number of keys in the returned object may be greater than one if the technology builds multiple files.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-method-signature-changes-in-the-base-class-of-the-technology\"><a href=\"#3-method-signature-changes-in-the-base-class-of-the-technology\" class=\"anchor\"></a>3.

Custom auxiliary parameters can be also added to <code>opts</code>.</li>\n<li>Only one argument <code>output</code> instead of two (<code>outputDir</code>, <code>outputName</code>) is passed. It contains the path to the file (without suffix) which will be created.</li>\n<li>Instead of the argument <code>prefixes</code> (it contains the path to the potentially existing files at the levels, from which the build will be made) the argument %%files%% is passed. It&#39;s an array of files that exist on levels and have suffixes suitable for a build technology. An element of the array is an object with the following properties:<ul>\n<li><code>file</code> - the file name.</li>\n<li><code>absPath</code> - the absolute path to the file.</li>\n<li><code>lastUpdated</code> - modification date of the file.</li>\n<li><code>suffix</code> - the suffix of the file.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><code>getBuildPaths()</code> using the passed declaration (decl) and a list of levels returns a list of existing files which fall under the declaration. The list is represented as a hash in which the files are grouped by the suffix of the technology. For example:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-js\">{\n    css: [{...}, {...}, {...}],\n    js: [{...}, {...}],\n    bemhtml: [{...}, {...}, {...}, {...}]\n}\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li><code>saveLastUsedData(file, data)/getLastUsedData(file)</code> saves or loads a list of files from which the technology built the file last time. It is used for validation: a file has to be built or it&#39;s already exist and it was built from the same file from which can be built now.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The standard way of the v2 methods execution looks like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/15566/158800653.1/0_111ffa_4cae794c_orig\"/></p>\n<p><code>buildByDecl()</code> is the entry point, it calls <code>getBuildResults()</code>. The result is a hash, where the key is a file suffix and the value is an array of strings with the file content. For example for the technology <code>i18n.js</code> it can look like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-js\">{\n &#39;en.js&#39;: [&#39;...&#39;, &#39;...&#39;, ...],\n &#39;ru.js&#39;: [&#39;...&#39;, &#39;...&#39;, &#39;...&#39;, ...],\n &#39;tr.js&#39;: [&#39;...&#39;, &#39;...&#39;, ...]\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>storeBuildResults</code> receives the hash and saves content to files.</p>\n<p>To build the hash <code>getBuildResults()</code> receives a list of files by calling <code>getBuildPaths()</code>.\nThe list contains all files that are contained at the levels of definition which are used, and that are appropriate for the build technology.\nThat is the suffixes which correspond to what is written in the technology <code>getBuildSuffixesMap()</code>.\nThen for each suffix (in the case of i18n.js it is en.js, ru.js, etc) <code>storeBuildResults()</code> is called and\na list of files filtered by a specific suffix is passed to it.</p>\n<p>Each file path is processed by <code>getBuildResultChunk</code>. The output is a string with the file content.</p>\n<p>Depending on the technology it may be or obtained file path wrapped in connection directive or the file content read from the disk.</p>\n<p><strong>Stay BEMed!</strong></p>\n"

And while we are awaiting a new truly mobile design, we tried our best to improve our current version. You can check <a href=\"https://en.bem.info\">bem.info</a> from your mobile phone or tablet now and see what we have got for the meantime. </p>\n<p>We concentrated on availability of the content (articles, documentation, etc.) on a small screen. To ease reading, we hid some elements that are available in our desktop version.</p>\n<p>The way it works:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Magic begins with device windows size smaller than 980px.</li>\n<li>We have only desktop bem.info version now for all device types; therefore, we implement all required functionality in the mobile version using media-query.</li>\n<li>To make a main menu friendly and usable, we added a control element into a header to open and close the menu easily;</li>\n<li>The header doesn&#39;t stick to the top of the page anymore and give us some more space. Now in mobile browsers, one click on the window title returns you to the top of the screen. So, there is no need to show the title all the time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What we plan:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Get back search.</li>\n<li>Add an option of opening desktop version on mobile devices.</li>\n<li>Get users feedback and improve our next mobile version accordingly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As we mentioned above, this mobile version is transitional. We would be happy to hear all your wishes, notes and propositions to improve the next version.</p>\n<p>Write us at <a href=\"mailto:info@bem.info\">info@bem.info</a> or chat with us on <a href=\"https://gitter.im/bem/talk\">Gitter</a>.

            "body": "\n<p>Hi everyone,</p>\n<p>I can&#39;t wait to share my impressions on the past first Hackathon on BEM! It was first hackathon in my life, and I already acted as a mentor. Let me tell you the truth — I liked it a lot :)</p>\n<p>And I am going to tell you everything step-by-step.</p>\n<h2 id=\"prehistory\"><a href=\"#prehistory\" class=\"anchor\"></a>Prehistory</h2>\n<p>First of all, I will tell you about myself:</p>\n<p>My name is <a href=\"http://en.bem.info/authors/belaya-inna/\">Inna Belaya</a>, and I manage a team that develops our technical documentation for BEM. Almost a year we, technical writers, together with development team are leading BEM documentation to its bright future. The way is thorny and bumpy, but we try our best :) We write, translate, follow users feedback and move towards being understandable.</p>\n<p>When the opportunity to meet in person and even better to work with BEM community developers appeared, I agreed with pleasure. This event allowed us</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To get feedback on current state of the documentation — what developers lack, what might be improved and needed to be improved;</li>\n<li>To improve the documentation and <a href=\"https://en.bem.info\">bem.info</a> together with the developers from BEM community;</li>\n<li>To set new goals in the future workload.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is not easy to be a mentor. I needed to work hard before the event in order to understand what problems we need to solve.</p>\n<p>I drafted the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lack of product information;</li>\n<li>Huge volumes of the current documentation;</li>\n<li>Complex, difficult-to-understand language of written documentation that makes understanding of complex technologies even more difficult;</li>\n<li>Billingualism.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, these problems were set to priority as possible tasks for hackathon, and</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To revise <strong>bem.info structure</strong> in order to give complete understanding of BEM methodology, platform – libraries, tools, technologies – and product community, to simplify search and understanding of the information;</li>\n<li>To develop <strong>basic principles</strong> for providing information on the site;</li>\n<li>Possibly to <strong>translate missing parts</strong> of the documents.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/15539/44214498.bc/0_9bbeb_1b0515f0_XL.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"it-is-time-to-hack\"><a href=\"#it-is-time-to-hack\" class=\"anchor\"></a>It is time to hack!</h2>\n<h3 id=\"few-common-words-\"><a href=\"#few-common-words-\" class=\"anchor\"></a>Few common words :)</h3>\n<p>Hackathon was planned accordingly: all participants meet and get to know each other the day earlier. We had a dinner together and a little tour on Yandex.Moscow. When we meet the next day, we felt comfortable already knowing each other. Everyone was a little nervous because of coming tasks and projects presentations. Greeting speech of <a href=\"https://en.bem.info/authors/jetpyspayeva-yelena/\">Yelena Jetpyspayeva</a> (known as Mursya) and <a href=\"https://en.bem.info/authors/grinenko-vladimir/\">Vladimir Grinenko</a> was very heartful and informal and switched everyone to this wave. Positive touch lasted all 48 hours.</p>\n<h3 id=\"project-presentation-and-forming-the-teams\"><a href=\"#project-presentation-and-forming-the-teams\" class=\"anchor\"></a>Project presentation and forming the teams</h3>\n<p>Mentors were supposed to create an idea, form a team and lead it to production. When the registration for hackathon was opened, we could see who and how many developers are interested in the topic. However to know for sure how many of them finally join the team, we could only after the presentation itself. Every mentor had to present his project in any convenient way and compete for the developers with the other mentors. There were no corporate templates or rules how to present, everyone decided for himself. However, all the presentations resulted in interesting and often humorous performances :)</p>\n<p>After the presentations there were time for the participants to decide which team to join. Many were in two minds about what group to choose. Because all of the projects were challenging. I was worried, would the developers join my team, would the documentation problems be interesting for the developers. But it ended better then ever, and I finally had a team of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.bem.info/authors/harisov-vitaly/\">Vitaly Harisov</a>, who created BEM</li>\n<li>Victoria Fillipova</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.bem.info/authors/baranov-mikhail/\">Mikhail Baranov</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/17934/44214498.bd/0_9bc0a_7c0c5de_XL.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Once teams were set, everyone get himself a place and started working. Long hours of silence with short friendly breaks on coffeepoints, pizza time and sweets breaks began.</p>\n<p>Let me go into details about the place of hackathon: organizers did their best to make it comfortable. Here were working places for everyone taste: openspaces with big marker board walls, small meeting rooms with round tables, bigger rooms, where teams got together to discuss work. Behind glass doors you could oftenly hear lively discussions of the projects. Work was in full swing. And who was tired, could get some privacy in hammock room.</p>\n<h3 id=\"team-work-tasks-the-process\"><a href=\"#team-work-tasks-the-process\" class=\"anchor\"></a>Team work, tasks, the process</h3>\n<p>My team chose the big room and shared it with another one. We started our work. I was surprised that documentation team was joined by the developer that knows BEM full stack of technologies. Every other team would kill for such an asset! It was an additional layer of responsibility for us :)</p>\n<p>We started to discuss tasks that I prepared beforehand and soon enough decided to start working on the structure of the site.</p>\n<p>We had two basic goals:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Revise bem.info current structure and understand why it is uncomfortable;</li>\n<li>Develop the basic principles for preparation of the information on the site and its publication, that it would help developers.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Faced the problem of inefficiency working all together on every other task. We understood that we started from the wrong side and had different points of view about the discussion subject.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/15483/44214498.bc/0_9bbea_9d1a1876_XL.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>We overcame difficulties and went further on. Started to work on the new structure but everyone from his side (we split roles) – somebody analyzed materials on the other sites, somebody decided how to formalize text, somebody worked on the structure itself. We decided to take not only our own preferences, but to hear out the developers that use our documentation. This is how our survey was born.</p>\n<p>First of all we questioned hackathon participants, than asked the community. We created a survey and asked everyone to fill it in. Many thanks to everyone who found 5 minutes and helped us with answers! Surprisingly the majority did it. Data continued to come during the whole hackathon, even at 3 a.m. and 8 a.m!</p>\n<p>What we have found out:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Current amount of documentation is enough for almost a half of developers (Yes – 41% / No – 59%);</li>\n<li>When they lack documentation, they lack step-by-step manuals on «setting and tuning in production», «using together with backend-frameworks», «setting building samples and tests», «on i-bem.js with all methods and samples», video lessons, «simple tutorials», «navigation guide on documentation»;</li>\n<li>Documentation on technologies, BEMHTML reference, documentation on libraries and quick start with project-stub helped working with BEM;</li>\n<li>The following content of bem.info is popular: «Technologies» – 24%, «Libraries» – 24%, «Forum (only Russian version is available in the meantime)» – 16%, «Tools» – 11%, «Talks» – 10%, «Articles» – 8%, «Methodology» – 6%;</li>\n<li>The majority of questioned think that BEM documentation is hard to understand – 74% vs. 26%;</li>\n<li>Developers choose big volumes of documentation if they structured well (36%) and workshops (26%). Some are willing to watch lessons (19%). Short documentation needed only by 17%;</li>\n<li>Almost all questioned agree that the site lacks interactive samples and manuals, video lessons and graphical support of the text;</li>\n<li>We were pleased to hear that &quot;we did a great job on restructuring and complementing documentation, it is now MORE BETTER, thank you!».</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The task delegation approach was efficient: before a dinner time we had ready-to-go brand a new structure of the site and basic rules for the content forming, that we want to follow in the future. Of course, it is a proposition that needs to be developed well and agreed with BEM team.</p>\n<p>In terms of hackathon we had not so much time left to solve all the problems. We decided to translate documentation that everyone was waiting for. Misha Baranov started to translate! And we added his profile to the <a href=\"https://en.bem.info/authors/baranov-mikhail/\">author page</a>, because all the translations were published under his name :) Thank you so much!</p>\n<p>First hard hack-day went to an end. People started leaving after 10 p.m., but there were developers working up to 3 a.m. and even until morning comes.</p>\n<p>Next day morning was sleepy. We met on coffeepoint, talked about projects. Time was running out and we needed to finish our work and prepare the presentation of the project.</p>\n<p>But.. we decided to start working on the next document. The idea came right after the answers we got in our survey. Developers told us that our current BEM quick start is not that quick. We worked all together to get done as much as we could! Vika wrote a text, Misha coded, I put two days work in the final slides.</p>\n<h3 id=\"presentations-of-results\"><a href=\"#presentations-of-results\" class=\"anchor\"></a>Presentations of results</h3>\n<p>One after another teams presented results of two day hackathon and told us the future plans.</p>\n<p>While presenting BEM Documentation team results, we showed the main idea of the new structure, described basic principles for preparation of the information on the site and its publication and discussed survey results. Misha showed new quick start idea in practice.</p>\n<p>During two days we finished the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Defined <strong>bem.info future development directions</strong> the idea of which is to divide methodological and platform parts and put every technology information into its own section.</li>\n<li>Developed <strong>basic principles for the content</strong>. This set of principles will be available on the site once the new structure is ready.</li>\n<li><strong>Got feedback</strong> and <strong>made conclusions</strong>. For instance, we though that one of the main problem is too big and difficult-to-understand documents. However the problem is not there. Our survey showed us that developers are ready to read big volumes if they structured well and &quot;seasoned&quot; with useful examples.</li>\n<li>Started working on the new document called &quot;Creating a static page according to BEM&quot; that is going to be truly useful and quick start for newcomers. Document is in development status. We plan to publish it in the nearest future.</li>\n<li><strong>The following documentation was translated</strong>:<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.bem.info/tools/bem/coa/\">COA</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.bem.info/tools/optimizers/borschik/freeze/\">Static resources &#39;freeze&#39;</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.bem.info/tools/optimizers/borschik/where-is-my-tech/\">Where is my tech</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.bem.info/tools/optimizers/borschik/js-include/\">JS include notations</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When everyone presented, we voted for the winners (yes, there was a competition!) and, or course, chose them! They got prizes (interesting books from <a href=\"http://www.mann-ivanov-ferber.ru/\">«Mann, Ivanov and Ferber»</a> printing house and T-shirt). And of course we did group and team photos. Than we had a dinner and a night Moscow walk.</p>\n<h2 id=\"resume-and-impressions\"><a href=\"#resume-and-impressions\" class=\"anchor\"></a>Resume and impressions</h2>\n<p>During the hackathon our team managed to finish not only the main tasks but did a little beyond. Two days were productive and filled with emotions!</p>\n<p>After that I had a lot of new ideas on what to prepare before the new hackathon (I do not question if it would be, I am sure it would :) ), how to manage time well, what problems to examine before the hackathon and how to manage the team and the process.</p>\n<p>Impressions and inspiration are more than enough for a long time! These two days were filled with team work and emotions, common goals, team spirit! I was pleased that the competition was healthy, common touch was supported by common help and advises: developers from different teams discussed their tasks and even (this is totally cool!) used what they created as early-adopters! This was soulful and awesome!</p>\n<p>Thank you so much and <strong>Stay BEMed</strong>!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/17893/44214498.be/0_9bc3a_372492bd_XL.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n"

            "body": "\n<p>Hi everyone,</p>\n<p>The first BEM hackathon took place in Moscow, on 14 - 16 November, 2014. It took us long to go from an idea to the actual realization, and we would now like to share our experience, achievements, and plans for the future with you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-little-background-history\"><a href=\"#a-little-background-history\" class=\"anchor\"></a>A little background history</h2>\n<p>We had an idea that we needed some sort of event to encourage community building. An event to get our community together to discuss projects, difficulties that developers face, and think of some common solutions together.</p>\n<p>A year and a half ago we started to move away from conferences towards the smaller scale format of <a href=\"https://events.yandex.ru/events/bemup/\">BEMups</a> — BEM meetups, six of which have since been held in Moscow, Saint Petersburg, and Minsk. Such meetups gave us a lot: informal communication, opportunities to meet real people that use our technology, the chance to get to know everyone in person and discuss real-life problems related to specific products — and we no longer had to deal with certain restrictions, such as limited time for Q&amp;A sessions, inevitable in conferences due to the sheer size of the audience.</p>\n<p>In meetings, we started to move away from just talking towards coding, inviting more experienced developers, helping newcomers via online chat, making \nsure everyone was getting somewhere. As time went by, we realized that we could go further. Now that the number of developers able to use the full BEM technology stack was high enough to run a hackathon, we could finally do it. So we prepared projects and tasks, picked a date, opened registration and braced ourselves. Even if it lead us nowhere, it would still be an experience we could use later on.</p>\n<p>We were in for a pleasant surprise!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/15496/44214498.bb/0_9bb8e_38cba625_XL.jpg\" alt=\"Teams are getting ready\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"how-we-did-it\"><a href=\"#how-we-did-it\" class=\"anchor\"></a>How we did it</h2>\n<p>First, a few words about the format we chose for our hackathon based on the logic we followed and tasks we came up with, and also how we did it.</p>\n<p>We&#39;d planned the hackathon as a two-day event spanning a weekend, with two extra days before and after — one for all the introductions, one for goodbyes and departures. We welcomed the participants on the Friday, introductions were made, we discussed the programme, showed everybody around our Yandex office, had dinner together in the Yandex canteen and went home to get some rest before the event.</p>\n<p>It was an early start for us on the Saturday morning, around 9 a.m., with  breakfast in the venue, followed by project presentations (mentors here each presented their projects to the participants in order to recruit enough people into their teams, to try and complete the necessary tasks together in the timeframe available) and forming of the teams (each participant could join only one team).</p>\n<p>We ended up with 8 teams out of 12 projects presented, which proceeded to work on their projects. They had just over 24 hours to code. Discussing tasks, deadlines, planning, interim results on an improvised kanban — we had it all. In every corner of our co-working space you would run into groups of people talking, drawing charts and diagrams on whiteboards, writing code, and occasionally popping out to take a nap in the hammock room :)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/15593/44214498.bc/0_9bbe3_ccfc51f8_XL.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>On the Sunday afternoon the teams presented their projects and results of the two-day hackathon. The goal was to get the maximum number of tasks up to production level. Many teams finished their job at 75-80% ”done“ level — we have scheduled the publication of the results on <a href=\"https://en.bem.info/blog\">bem.info/blog</a>.</p>\n<p>Successfull teamwork was rewarded with some books published by <a href=\"http://www.mann-ivanov-ferber.ru/\">Mann, Ivanov &amp; Ferber</a>, presents from Yandex, cheers and laughter, photo-taking to preserve the memory of the event, and a dinner for all.</p>\n<p>The main idea and point of the hackathon were not to compete for some material trophies but to collaborate on something that would contribute to the BEM community development and help other projects. And it looks like we managed to achieve just that!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/15575/44214498.bc/0_9bbdf_2fb3664_XL.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"what-counts\"><a href=\"#what-counts\" class=\"anchor\"></a>What counts</h2>\n<p>We announced our hackathon 2.5 months in advance — a significant period of time to keep registration open. However it was unavoidable. The selection process was labourious, applicants had to show their own BEM products or pass a test, we had to review their code, make sure nothing was missing and start to communicate with prospective participants. In other words, make all the necessary arrangements, cover travel expenses, sort out accommodation. Mentors of the projects had to think of tasks and goals, plan teamwork, try to foresee possible questions and think of the answers to them. We were not bored at all.</p>\n<p>We received <strong>34 applications</strong> in total. 23 invitations were sent out after the review, 15 participants attended the event. 5 of them were not from Moscow but came from Saint Petersburg, Orenburg, Voronezh, Ekaterinburg. Our colleagues at Yandex showed interest as well and came to code with us. The teams included 13 Yandex developers. We had <strong>14 mentors</strong> (some larger teams had two mentors), 4 of them were not from Yandex.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/16115/44214498.bc/0_9bbed_a19cf4db_XL.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>All the work at our hackathon was based around projects. <strong>Originally we had 12 projects planned</strong>. 7 of them were created by the BEM team, 5 by developers from the BEM community.</p>\n<p>After the introduction session we had 8 left to work on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Blocks</li>\n<li>Modular building of BEM projects</li>\n<li>BEM forum</li>\n<li>Dashboard</li>\n<li>Documentation</li>\n<li>A service that converts code into images with BEM syntax highlighted</li>\n<li>MaximeOnline: content management system</li>\n<li>BEM application for SmartTV</li>\n</ul>\n<p>How everything went, what goals developers pursued and what they achieved in the end — all of that will be chronicled by our mentors and published in our blog in the nearest future!</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit-poll-results\"><a href=\"#exit-poll-results\" class=\"anchor\"></a>Exit poll results</h2>\n<p>Once an event is over, we like to get the participants&#39; feedback on it. We value your opinion and are constantly seeking to improve our events.</p>\n<p>We have done our own <strong>exit poll</strong> on the hackathon and would like to share the results with you!</p>\n<p>We had both mentors and participants taking part in the survey at a ratio of 40 to 60. <strong>100 percent of respondents felt satisfied</strong> with their teams, mentors, participants. Almost 100 percent were also satisfied with the level of preparation in the area of technology. Admittedly, we did follow a rather rigourous selection process at the registration stage, making sure that participants had the required level of BEM and JS knowledge given that the hackathon was about coding, not learning JS.</p>\n<p>Despite our worries, it didn&#39;t take long for most of the teams to do task planning and allocation. Task planning was done together, as a group effort in most of the teams. According to our survey, 80 percent of the developers believe they were able to ”achieve all of the planned goals“.</p>\n<p><strong>The format of the hackathon</strong> was generally found to be a very comfortable and optimal one. Although, some developers wish they&#39;d been able to start a bit later, sleep in the venue, work for longer than two days or not have to leave at all. All of these suggestions will be taken into account in the future!</p>\n<p>This time most of the projects were prepared by our team. Therefore we wanted to find out whether participants found our ideas useful and interesting to implement. 90 percent of the respondents found them to be so. We are happy to know that and we also think it would be great if developers brought their own projects and their own ideas to help enrich the BEM world!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/15595/44214498.bc/0_9bbf9_f5dae655_XL.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>As to the factors that prevented teams from achieving their intended project goals (bringing their projects to a desired level), respondents cite a lack of technical skills in one or more team players, lack of time, risks of launching services on different platforms, insufficient architecture planning, wrong estimates of task complexity vs. team expertise.</p>\n<p><strong>What could improve future events</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Work on your skills beforehand so as not to slow down the team&#39;s progress.</li>\n<li>Configure the environment beforehand so as not to slow down the team&#39;s progress.</li>\n<li>Think the architecture through beforehand to save time.</li>\n<li>Estimate the complexity of the tasks, team effort, timelines; plan and break tasks down into subtasks if necessary to improve efficiency.</li>\n<li>Prepare projects with varying levels of difficulty — for beginners, to create really cool and useful stuff.</li>\n<li>Create projects that make use of the full BEM stack.</li>\n<li>If there is an excess of ideas, have a vote on all the projects proposed to narrow the list down so that we can have about 5 devs per team, which should lead to better results.</li>\n<li>Aim for more community-driven projects.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let us also quote some of your comments:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>”The main idea of any hackathon is to have this atmosphere of creativity and healthy competition. So it would be great to have more original projects from the community“.</p>\n<p>”I must say that prescreening of developers&#39; skills was done well enough, so there was no need to explain BEM anymore. The Blocks team had the ideal situation: every block is a separate task, the project is already configured, there are examples of other blocks and a format. As a result, everyone picked a task that matched his skills and completed it so that it could be presented. Of course one solid task is way more interesting than a number of small ones but with 8-10 hours at your disposal that was ideal“.</p>\n<p>”We should send at least one BEM-friend to every project we have. There were teams lacking in people from the BEM team/Yandex. And it was hard enough to code and to answer questions at the same time“.</p>\n<p>”We need to have more independent projects in the future. Something like what developers from the Pictures team did“.</p>\n<p>”The BEM hackathon was supercool! However, I think we should stay away from non-block-based projects. I think projects like bem-ide or build tools are not that interesting unless you know all the ins and outs :(“</p>\n<p>”I am a hackathon nymphomaniac. I just can&#39;t help it, I love to hack. ^<strong><em>_</em></strong>^“</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/15526/44214498.bc/0_9bbfc_3f7ab8a0_XL.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>However, not everyone was so upbeat. <strong>Two developers were sad</strong> about certain things, so we would like to respond to their complaints.</p>\n<p>One respondent complains about a project the essence of which was unclear from the presentation, pointing out that the mentor had ”spent two days doing nothing and the end result showed nothing.“ He advises us to avoid such kind of projects in the future. That&#39;s a good point. We will watch out for that kind of attitude in the future. This time we allowed ourselves to rely on the participants&#39; self-discipline, their own enthusiasm for comminity building, and the fact that the rules of the event applied to all attendees, including the rule that states that ”if no one joins your team and you are not likely to deliver the project in two days on your own, you should team up with another project to help others deliver on time“. After a few reminders, queries and recommendations to join other teams, we decided not to push too hard and just see what happens. Next time we shall be stricter.</p>\n<p>Another participant points to the ”rather disappointing fact that the only two non-Yandex-based teams that were making some effort trying to code something got zero points in the voting.“ He suggests we show them some support. Their ideas were OK, in his view, the team was somewhat lacking in technical and marketing skills. He also finds blocks and the development of existing projects to be a strange idea for a hackathon. </p>\n<p>Now, we couldn&#39;t disagree more with that view and here&#39;s why. Our hackathon was planned as a project for the community, where we can code together to create and opensource something that will be of use to many developers. Half of the eight projects presented at the event were exactly about that — Blocks (which everyone needs), Build (modules for third-party build tools that facilitate the building of BEM projects), Documentation (for the technologies used by everyone) and Forum (where people discuss BEM). These teams were staffed mainly by people from the community.</p>\n<p>Next, there were four external projects - Dashboard, Pictures, Maxim and SmartTV. The <a href=\"http://instagram.com/p/vdvuzDjYhP/?modal=true\">results of the vote</a> show that Dashboard won first place with 11 votes, Pictures shared fourth place with the Documentation team. Maxim and SmartTV both got zero points. That is indeed disappointing but it is hardly biased, since, as we all know, all the participants voted after all the projects were presented to them. The latter two teams showed poor results compared to the others.</p>\n<p>All we can do is suggest these teams improve their task planning skills, prepare their presentations better, work harder on their projects during the hackathon or maybe join other teams — which can also make sense — you end up gaining some knowledge and experience, doing you bit for the community and helping a lot of developers.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/16122/44214498.bb/0_9bb8d_139fee96_XL.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Our hackathon did not involve prizes as such. While planning it, we thought we should be <strong>driven by the idea to make the BEM world better</strong>. Does everyone share that view? Your feedback certainly tells us so. Many share the view of ”no prizes are needed, I&#39;m happy to contribute to the common cause“ or that ”having promotional prizes is enough“. However, we&#39;ll think of ways to encourage you more in the future.</p>\n<p>Thank you so much for all the ideas and for taking part in the hackathon!</p>\n<p>We were very happy to learn that the majority valued the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Knowledge and experience sharing.</li>\n<li>The ability to write blocks correctly.</li>\n<li>Acquiring skills on the go during the hackathon and from experienced developers.</li>\n<li>Getting to know their colleagues.</li>\n<li>Finding answers to their BEM questions and contributing to BEM development.</li>\n<li>Finding necessary information about further development and plans.</li>\n<li>Building ties with the BEM community and establishing contacts.</li>\n<li>Taking part in real BEM projects.</li>\n<li>Watching how others manage at the hackathon.</li>\n<li>Learning how to manage the process.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Someone wrote to us saying that he&#39;d ”learnt to find answers to questions about i-bem.js, tried his hand at writing tests, received some useful feedback on his coding style, learnt to notice things he&#39;d treated as unimportant before“. The hackathon helped him ”identify the gaps in his knowledge as well as his professional development path for the next couple of years. So pluses all around really. Besides, I was able to complete my share of work, as straighforward as it was from an experienced developer perspective“.</p>\n<p>Sounds cool.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/16142/44214498.bc/0_9bbf6_afb95b1_XL.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"afterword\"><a href=\"#afterword\" class=\"anchor\"></a>Afterword</h2>\n<p>By way of afterword I would like to quote some more of your emotions — in the end, that was what really made our weekend!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>”The atmosphere was fun and friendly. Thank you so much, colleagues from the BEM forum team! It&#39;s a pity I could not be with you on the second day. Please keep me posted, I&#39;ll gladly attend more BEM events. So look out for new pull requests! I&#39;m looking forward to seeing the results in production! Good luck and all the best to you all!“, — Yura Malakhov.</p>\n<p>”Thank you! :) It was cool to see so much cool stuff being done in just two days“,\n— Kolya Mendyaev.</p>\n<p>”You are great! The achievements idea is really awesome!“,\n— Pasha Akhmetchanov.</p>\n<p>”It was the best hackathon ever! Thank you“,\n— Zhenya Solovyev.</p>\n<p>”Thank you for the hackathon! Let&#39;s make it a quarterly thing!“,\n— Lesha Yaroshevich.</p>\n<p>”The most vivid memory for me is the warm friendly atmosphere. It was conducive to making new acquintances, networking and active experience sharing. The event was very well organized. You could feel the presence of BEM team spirit — everyone was committed to creating useful and original products. There were a lot of top-notch ideas and cool people. You could see a collaborative spirit at work in the teams, everyone supported each other and tried their best to get good results. There competition was high but healthy as well“,\n— <a href=\"https://en.bem.info/authors/belaya-inna/\">Inna Belaya</a>.</p>\n<p>”Not every team managed to achieve their original goals and get their project to its intended state. But everyone got their reward in the end, i.e. experience, and that&#39;s what really matters! The main drawback of the BEM hackathon is that it was too short“,\n— Sasha Tikvach.</p>\n<p>”An unexpectedly high number of people from the BEM community showed up for the hackathon, and in just two days they managed to do something that in normal circumstances would take weeks to complete. I liked the well-coordinated team work and the end results. Well done to you all! Let&#39;s keep going“,\n— <a href=\"https://en.bem.info/authors/harisov-vitaly/\">Vitaly Harisov</a>.</p>\n<p>”The first BEM hackathon met my expectations by 120 percent. The organizers did their best to create an atmosphere that inspires you to code, achieve goals, share your experience with the BEM community and learn about others&#39; experience\nin using the methodology, technology and tools. I was pleasantly surpised by the participants&#39; level. The guys in the BEM Forum team clearly study BEM, use it in their projects and intend to keep on using it. They helped a lot, completed a number of important tasks while also improving their knowledge of the BEM platform with our help. I&#39;m very much satisfied and I hope there&#39;ll be more hackathons in the future!“\n— Kolya Ilchenko.</p>\n<p>”I really liked the way the hackathon was organized — our dinner together the day before the event proper, food and beverages throughout, workstations with a good Internet connection - everything was sorted, so we could concentrate on the work at hand. The teamwork was well coordinated, people were helping each other. The prize for me were all the blocks that we wrote“,\n— Evgeny Konstantinov.</p>\n<p>”Guys, help you so much for the hackathon! Thanks for the trust, for your interest, for the willingness to work on a weekend with no money of gift incentive, for understanding the goals and sharing our views! You&#39;re really doing a lot. Please keep it up!“\n— <a href=\"https://en.bem.info/authors/jetpyspayeva-yelena/\">Mursya</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A lot more posts on the hackathon results are coming soon.

Presumably there should be enough of a script that will call Stylus for every <em>.styl within design/</em>.blocks/*/ by now. The necessity of building remains, however requirements for the stack used are softened.</p>\n<h2 id=\"library\"><a href=\"#library\" class=\"anchor\"></a>Library</h2>\n<p>Here we include pre-compiled JS and CSS into the project, go to <a href=\"https://en.bem.info/\">bem.info</a>, copy HTML from the examples, and everything works. To do so in the minimal variant we need to write a declaration that will list all the entities from the library. Then we can build resulting JS- and CSS-bundles.</p>\n<p><strong>Ideally</strong> we would prefer to have a form on bem.info, where you can check needed entities and as a result get your final custom bundle. However, it’s all in plans for now.</p>\n<p>Email us at <a href=\"mailto:info@bem.info\">info@bem.info</a> with a subject &quot;bem-components&quot;.</p>\n<p><strong>Stay BEMed!</strong></p>\n"

This means we encourage you to use it in your home projects and report bugs. </p>\n<p>The repository could be found <a href=\"https://github.com/bem/bem-forum/\">here</a>. Local copy installation instruction is in it&#39;s <a href=\"https://github.com/bem/bem-forum/blob/master/README.md\">readme file</a>. </p>\n<p>Forum&#39;s architecture allows using it well as a separate service and as a route for <a href=\"http://expressjs.com/\">express</a>. We use it in a second capacity — it is a part of bem.info site.</p>\n<p>We use github API as a source of data, node.js for backend and full stack of BEM (<a href=\"https://en.bem.info/technology/bemtree/v2/bemtree/\">BEMTREE</a>, <a href=\"https://en.bem.info/technology/bemhtml/v2/intro/\">BEMHTML</a>, i-bem.js) for frontend.</p>\n<p>Right now it is possible on BEM forum to open a topic, comment it and filter posts using labels. We already made few necessary for you there. Attention: we ask you to use our forum via bem.info interface, because here you can have it labeled and found by others.</p>\n<p>Every post is an issue on github that we browse on the site. This scheme allows communicating via forum having what developers already have — github login. For you it also means that you can open topics via bem.info site&#39;s interface or directly on github. </p>\n<p>All you need to start using BEM forum is to authorize via oAuth using your github login. </p>\n<p>Start writing your first post right now! We as a BEM team and guys from the community monitor user questions all the time and answer them right away. </p>\n<p>We also hope you open our eyes on the problems English language developers have with BEM (anything from documentation to demos, from installation to use cases). Just mark such posts with &quot;bug&quot; label. It will be a lot of a help!</p>\n<p>Let&#39;s get started with BEM forum!</p>\n<p>To keep in touch and <strong>Stay BEMed!</strong></p>\n"

However, since that time we have released minor updates with some improvements.</p>\n<p>As we have written already we decided to do so because we switched to <a href=\"https://en.bem.info/tools/bem/enb-bem/\">build with ENB</a>.</p>\n<p>Today we can confirm that ENB supports all options of <code>bem make</code> and even more. Besides, it works faster and is being developed \nby leaps and bounds (soon you will be expecting major releases of the most popular packages).</p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-inside-bem-tools-v0100\"><a href=\"#whats-inside-bem-tools-v0100\" class=\"anchor\"></a>What&#39;s inside bem-tools v0.10.0?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/bem/bem-tools/releases/tag/v0.10.0\">Inside</a> we have done a fallback that in absence of <code>.bem/make.js</code> will \nsearch for <code>ENB</code> config and will launch it under the hood. In other words launch of <code>bem make</code> out of <code>bem-tools</code> runs <code>enb make</code>, \nand launch of <code>bem server</code> runs <code>enb server</code>. </p>\n<p>Such a way allows us to preserve its usual API and an option to use the rest of the commands of <code>bem-tools</code> (for instance, \n<code>bem create</code>) when users need them. </p>\n<p>Also in the future it will give us an opportunity to add other useful modules to work with files according to BEM methodology in \nthe common wrapper.</p>\n<p>We continue to suggest you to switch to <code>ENB</code> build if you still haven&#39;t done it yet.</p>\n<p>The simplest way to do so is to check the config sample within the <a href=\"https://github.com/bem/project-stub/blob/bem-core/.enb/make.js\">project-stub</a> \nand if you have diffuculties, ask on our <a href=\"https://en.bem.info/forum/\">forum</a>.</p>\n<p>Bon appetit and <strong>Stay BEMed!</strong></p>\n"

I do not know how such events should be, but everything went pretty well.  I had\nconcrete expectations, and my expectations were met. It is worth a lot to look in the eyes of those who have the same &#39;BEM brain&#39; as I do! It was interesting to listen to the talks and comments of Yandex developers and guys from the industry.</p>\n<p>I would like to highlight a talk about Islands libraries. It would be great to have more details such as this\ntalk was about. It is interesting to hear about real projects, solutions, and not only from Yandex, as well\nas to ask questions and even troll. Personally I was asked more about processes than technologies. How to prove BEM\nis a good choice to my colleagues? How many projects we do using BEM? How to agree with each other? How\nto start with a block library out of your project?</p>\n<p>I really hope you will continue this start, and BEMups will be regular events. Because this is a great option to\nexchange experience and motivate yourself to achieve the next BEM level. I, for instance, was inspired to\nfinish a something I postponed for half a year! Thanks to Yandex and you guys for such an event. Staying BEMed,\nVasya.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The BEM team also made few conclusions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://twitter.com/ya_mishanga\">Mikhail Troshev</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Developers use our project-stub, we need to keep it in an up-to-date fixed and working condition. This is a BEM face\nfor most of the people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://twitter.com/veged\">Sergey Berezhnoy</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>During a coffee break I heard some developers talk to each other about how they use BEM technologies\nand how they implemented them. It is cool that non-Yandex developers argued for BEM before the others.</p>\n<p>We need to continue BEMuping but think twice what we give developers, why they come to BEMup and are going\nto come. For instance, several people said they lack concrete technical examples and talks (maybe even workshops).\nWe may not need to go that way, but we need to formulate the essence of the event first.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://twitter.com/tadatuta\">Vladimir Grinenko</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I was surprised to see such a high percentage of developers using bem-tools. I thought I would need to explain what\nbem-tools are before getting into news. But they knew already!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://twitter.com/dosyara\">Sergey Maksimov</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The meetup went well. Those who came really use the idea and believe in it. Without such an audience the result might\nbe different. I think it is worthwhile to ask external speakers to share not only their «success stories» but more\nconcrete examples of realization.</p>\n<p>The overall feeling still associates BEM with a naming convention and with structuring a page with blocks, elements, all that stuff. Those who tried to go further and use Yandex&#39; experience faced imperfection and opacity of our inner processes. For instance, an absence of development plans, clear release cycles, absence (or bad quality) of documentation. There are serious issues for a serious development.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thanks to the meetup we have all this feedback (and more). We will be working towards an\nimprovement of the product and sharing this with you during future BEMups.</p>\n<p>Such events and your feedback help us a lot to see those we can not see because of specifics of work. Thank you so much!</p>\n<p>More than <strong>50 front-end developers</strong> and IT leaders from Moscow, Ekaterinburg, Orenburg, Ivanovo, Serpukhov, Obninsk, Volgograd came to meetup.</p>\n<p>Watch how we did it in a promo video with English subtitles.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/4jrUgqMlvP0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<p>If you use BEM technologies in your projects and want to share your experience with us, write us at info@bem.info</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://bitly.com/bemup-photo\">Photos</a> from the event.</p>\n<p>Follow our news on <a href=\"http://bit.ly/fb-bem\">Facebook</a>, in <a href=\"http://bit.ly/en-twi\">Twitter</a> or on\nsite <a href=\"https://en.bem.info/\">bem.info</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Stay BEMed!</strong></p>\n"

We have analysed your responses and implemented many of your wishes in our new documentation!</p>\n<p>Here is the list of new features of documentation that were implemented:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Now we are able to show source files of blocks from all levels involved in the assembly. To see links to all the files of the block from all levels, you need to open a new tab of the block description — <a href=\"https://en.bem.info/libs/bem-components/v2/desktop/button/sources/\">Sources</a>. Thus, for example, for a desktop block there will be a set of files from desktop and common levels.</li>\n<li>We are able to show additional levels for the complex block examples from an ”Examples“ tab. For this we created a separate tab called ”custom blocks“ that contains links to all additional files.</li>\n<li>We also are able to show the dependencies for all examples in ”deps“ tab.</li>\n<li>We now highlight and format all code examples. We add formatting and highlighting of the code in BEMJSON and HTML tabs.</li>\n<li>And finally we are able to show HTML for custom examples in ”Examples“ tab.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hope these new updates will be useful!</p>\n<p>And of course, we want to thank all the respondents who participated in a survey! Your answers helped us dramatically in improvement of the documentation and understanding what is really important to you.</p>\n<p>We also added a permanent <a href=\"https://en.bem.info/feedback/\">feedback tab</a> on the main menu to give you a tool to report us what you think back any time you like. You can do this by mail as well: <a href=\"mailto:info@bem.info\">info@bem.info</a>.</p>\n<p>Enjoy usage and <strong>Stay BEMed!</strong></p>\n"
